Introduction
Understanding data structures is crucial for solving a wide range of computational problems efficiently. This repository provides C and C++ implementations of commonly used data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, along with various operations that can be performed on these structures.

Data Structures
The following data structures are currently implemented in this repository in both C and C++:

Arrays

Dynamic Arrays
Linked Lists

Singly Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Circular Linked List
Stacks

Array-based Stack
Linked List-based Stack
Queues

Array-based Queue
Linked List-based Queue
Trees

Binary Search Tree (BST)
AVL Tree
Red-Black Tree
Heap (Min-Heap and Max-Heap)
Graphs

Adjacency List
Adjacency Matrix
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Each data structure is organized into its own directory with separate C and C++ files for implementation.

Operations
For each data structure, there are various operations and algorithms implemented, including but not limited to:

Insertion and Deletion
Searching and Traversal
Sorting and Searching Algorithms (e.g., binary search)
Specialized operations (e.g., balancing operations for trees)
Detailed documentation and examples for using these operations can be found within each data structure's respective directory.

Getting Started
To use the implementations in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-c-cpp.git
Navigate to the data structure you're interested in, e.g., data-structures-c-cpp/stacks.

Compile and run the C or C++ files to see the implementations in action or integrate them into your own C or C++ projects as needed.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it for educational purposes or in your C and C++ projects.

Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have improvements or additional data structures and algorithms to add, please follow these guidelines:

Fork this repository.
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
